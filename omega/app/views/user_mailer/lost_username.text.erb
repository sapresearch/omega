Hey, we heard you lost your username.

<% if @users.any? %>
After searching long and hard we were able to find the following usernames for your email:
<% @users.each do |user| %>
 - <%= user.username %>
<% end %>
<% else %>
Unfortunately we were unable to find any usernames associated with your email address <%= @email %>.
<% end %>

Thanks,
The Omega Team
