    <h3>Your Usernames</h3>
    <p>Hey, we heard you lost your username.</p>
<% if @users.any? %>
    <p>After searching long and hard we were able to find the following usernames for your email:<p>
    <ul>
      <% @users.each do |user| %>
      <li><%= user.username %></li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>
<% else %>
    <p>Unfortunately we were unable to find any usernames associated with your email address <b><%= @email %></b>.</p>
<% end %>
    <p>Thanks,<br />The Omega Team</p>
